# Hi ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Task-it

## Simplify Project Management and Task Collaboration

I've created Task-it as a side project to address a common pain point I face as a freelancer - managing project tasks for multiple clients. Task-it also provides me with an opportunity to work with exciting new technologies like Next.js 13, NextAuth, Tailwind CSS, Trpc, and Prisma DB. With Task-it, my goal is to develop a comprehensive full-stack application that brings together all the essential features in a single, user-friendly platform.

I invite you to join me on this exciting journey and contribute your suggestions and improvements along the way. ðŸ˜Ž

## Version 0:

In this initial version, our primary focus is on configuring and deploying the Task-it application. While doing so, we aim to maintain a sense of progress and inspiration throughout the development process. This version serves as a checkpoint, ensuring that we keep moving forward.

### **Tasks:**

- [x]  Implement a public login page with authentication options including Auth0, Facebook, Github, Discord, and Google.
- [x]  Create a private home page that displays user information.

## Version 1:

In the previous version, we successfully implemented the authentication feature, providing secure access to Task-it. Additionally, we established the necessary infrastructure to associate databases and application entities with user accounts, enabling efficient project tracking.

Building upon these foundations, our focus for Version 1 is to enhance user productivity and organization. The home page will offer a clear overview of active projects, while within each project, users will have access to a user-friendly kanban board for effective task management and collaboration.

By combining these essential features, Task-it simplifies project management, empowering users to stay organized and focused on their tasks.
